       "3. **\"The Republic\" by Plato** - Not only is this a central text for understanding Platonic philosophy, but it also provides a lens into Greek views on justice, governance, and society.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **\"Nicomachean Ethics\" by Aristotle** - In this philosophical work, Aristotle outlines his thoughts on virtue, character, and the life well-lived, giving readers a comprehensive view of Greek ethical thought.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **\"The Last Days of Socrates\" by Plato** - This collection includes \"Euthyphro,\" \"The Apology,\" \"Crito,\" and \"Phaedo,\" which together cover the trial and death of Socrates, offering a deep dive into his philosophy and the Athens of his time.\n",

       "7. **\"Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter\" by Thomas Cahill** - Part of the \"Hinges of History\" series, this book provides a narrative exploration of how ancient Greek culture still affects modern life in the Western world.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **\"The Greek Way\" by Edith Hamilton** - Celebrated for its engaging style, this book offers insights into Greek philosophy, politics, art, and poetry with clarity and depth.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **\"Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic\" by Tom Holland** - Although this book focuses on Rome, it gives significant attention to the influence of Greek culture on Rome. It's a gripping narrative that can provide context for understanding the broader ancient world.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **\"Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens\" by James Davidson** - This book presents a less often seen side of Greek life, focusing on the daily lives, social customs, and habits of ancient Athenians.\n",
